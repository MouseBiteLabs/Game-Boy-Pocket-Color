# MGBC-MBL-01

Version 2.1:
![green](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-Pocket-Color/assets/97127539/788a0b62-b69e-4dd4-8935-b024266fce41)

Version 2.0S:
![greenwhite](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-Pocket-Color/assets/97127539/01d0a46f-5057-4a89-8211-a1c87957da6c)

*Note: The v2.0 and v2.1 boards are nearly identical - the only difference is v2.1 has a notch cut in the bottom by the regulator.*

This is the main circuit board in the MGBC build. This README will provide instructions for how to customize the build to your liking, as well as attempt to clear up any questions you may have about the build process.

## Board Characteristics and Order Information

The zipped folder contains all the gerber files for this board, if you wish to order it from a board manufacturer yourself. Version 2.x refers to the PCB that is one solid color with little-to-no visible silkscreen on the front after assembly; Version 2.xS refers to the PCB that has the bottom half filled with slikscreen, to make it look like OEM Pocket boards.

-	Layers: 2
-	Thickness: 1 mm
-	Surface Finish: ENIG (or HASL, which is only acceptable if you are installing tactile buttons)
-   **NOTE: When ordering PCBs, add this note to the order: "The file milling.gbr contains outlines for plated slots. Please add plated slots on the PCB according to this layer."**

**I sell this board on Etsy, so you don't have to buy multiples from board fabricators:**

## Customization Options

This section will explain all of the different customization options available on this board while you assemble.

### Enabling Reset Button Functionality

Bridge the pads labelled "RST" with solder to turn the navigation switch into a reset button whenever you push it in. It's not particularly easy to push the button in, so accidental resets shouldn't be a concern. But if you find yourself accidentally resetting the system, you can remove the solder from the pads to disable it.

### Power LED Brightness

Increase the value of R9 to decrease the brightness of the power LED during normal battery levels. Increase the value of R10 to decrease the brightness of the power LED during low battery levels. It is suggested to try changing resistances in ~10 kÎ© increments.

### Tactile Switches

If you want clicky buttons, like the GBA SP has, then you can install tactile switches onto the button contacts. These are listed as B1-B8 on the BOM. There are three levels of clickiness to choose from, depending on the part number you select - SKRRAAE010 is the "least clicky" with 1 N operating force, SKRRABE010 has 1.6 N of operating force, and SKRRACE010 is the "most clicky" with 2 N of operating force. Note when installing the switches to make sure the little "wings" are oriented correctly as indicated on the board!

### Enabling the DC Jack (v2.0 and v2.1 only)

When making the system for use with AAAs, you must connect the two holes labelled BT+ and DC together with a wire or 0 ohm resistor. This is only required on v2.0 and later boards - v1.6 and earlier do not require this. Shorting these holes together connects the DC jack to the input of the regulator. So if you forget to add it, then your DC jack won't work (which may or may not matter to you anyway). DO NOT SHORT THESE TOGETHER IF USING A LITHIUM-ION BATTERY.

### LiPo Support

Are you using the Game Boy Pocket Power regulator for U5 for LiPo support? Are you sure you want to? Lithium-ion batteries are **dangerous** so if you're going to be using one... you're on your own. You're responsible for using it safely. 

But, I did make it *slightly* easier for you. If you're using either <a href="https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Protector-Power-Board/blob/main/README.md">my LiPo board</a> or the GBPP with LiPo, solder wires or headers from the DC and BT+ holes into the power board, thread the wires from the battery through the hole in the board to the power board connections, and remember to **REMOVE EM7** if your board revision is v1.6 or earlier. On v2.0 and v2.1, keep EM7 in place. You'll also need a USB-C adapter PCB to go in place of DC jack.

Also, to get the power LED to dim at the correct time, remove R6 from the main MGBC board.

If you're using Nataliethenerd's <a href="https://www.nataliethenerd.com/product-page/safer-charge-dc">Safer Charge DC</a>, connect a wire from the "To F1" pad on the back of the board to the BT+ hole on the MGBC, and a wire from the "To 5V" pad on the back of the board to the pad on the USB-C breakout board. Then install the board into the U5 socket as normal.

## Assembly References

Here are a few images that should help clarify the build process, as well as provide some brief technical explanations to guide you in troubleshooting any errors you might have.

### Part Placement

Some of the parts are a bit cramped, and it can be a bit difficult to decipher which part is which. Hopefully this image helps you clarify. (This is a photo from a previous version of the board, so the parts on your board may be slightly nudged from where they are in this image.)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97127539/235396199-3f610782-8782-44d2-b0a4-8c2cef4e248b.png)

### CPU Pin Functions

This is a bit of a mess, but depending on the problem you're encountering, it could be worth reflowing the pins on the CPU that correspond to the aspect you're having problems with.
- For miscolored screens, reflow the top display pins.
- For *glitchy* screens, or frozen/all-white screens, reflow the SRAM pins.
- If you're missing button inputs, reflow the bottom left corner button pins.
- If you have games that don't start up properly and hang at the Nintendo logo during start-up, display a glitchy Nintendo logo, or randomly freeze during gameplay, reflow the cartridge pins and clean your cartridge connector. The freezing may also be caused by poorly connected SRAM as well.
- Three link port pins are on the bottom right, but there is one lone one at the top.
- In general, reflowing the clock and power pins (colored red, pink, and black) can solve problems as well.

## PCB Errors

### v1.6 and earlier
- The up/down text for the rocker switch functions is flipped
### v1.5 and earlier
- The rocker switch can sometimes interfere with the shell. Light trimming on the shell may be required for smooth rocking.
- The BOM for builds v1.5 and earlier is different than the one currently in this repo. Please view the differences in the Excel or .csv file in the root directory.
### v1.4
- The button contacts are too responsive compared to Nintendo's button style. Use of tactile switches is recommended.


## Bill of Materials

This should be for reference only. This can be found in the main folder in Excel format. There is also a link in the main folder for a saved Mouser cart with all these parts.

*Note that this reflects the BOM for v1.6 and later. For earlier revisions, see the BOM Excel or .csv in the root folder of the repository.*

## Revision History

### v2.1 - Final Release

- Added a notch in the bottom of the board for easier routing of LiPo battery leads

### v2.0 - Release III

- Fixed up/down text for rocker switch functionality.
- Changed EM7 connection so it is required for power boards using AAAs *and* power boards using Lipo batteries.
  - Use of the DC jack with AAA batteries requires shorting the DC and BT+ holes.
- Added 3.3V to pin 37 on the FFC for compatibility with newer CGS screen kits.
- Reduced hole diameter for volume dial mounting

### v1.6 - Release II

- Added 100 uF capacitor across 5V rail to reduce voltage ripple
- Lowered default maximum volume
- Changed the low battery detection circuit for easier threshold calculations
- Expanded bottom hole for DC jack for compatibility with aftermarket parts
- Shifted some components for easier solderability
- Renamed LED1 to D2

### v1.5 - Release I

- Modified button contacts to feel more OEM-like
- Nudged SW2 to better fit in the shell, extend solder pads for easier assembly
- Flipped locations of the up and down pads for the rocker switch
- Modified battery terminal contacts to match OEM style

### v1.4 - Beta III

- Adjusted hole and part placement for better shell fitment
- Reverted button contacts to Beta I design for better actuation
- Renamed some parts to match OEM descriptions
- Created separate v1.4S version

### v1.3 - Beta II

- Shifted IPS screen kit connector down
- Removed load switch circuit and PTC input

### v1.1 - Alpha

- Changed name from MGBC-LCPU-01 to MGBC-MBL-01
- Flipped power switch to correct orientation
- Corrected power LED indicator dimming (v1.0 was backwards)
- Added pads for tactile buttons
