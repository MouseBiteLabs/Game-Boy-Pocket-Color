# Beta Tester Folder

I didn't want to delete all the beta tester information, so here it is if you're still one of the lucky few beta testers left out there ;)
Contact me with questions!

## Assembly Notes

1) Reset button capability
- Bridge the solder pads labeled RST (near bottom left of CPU) to turn the rocker switch into a reset button when you press the switch inwards.

2) Power LED brightness
- Change R9 to adjust the brightness (lower resistance, higher brightess; higher resistance, lower brightness)
- Change R10 to adjust the brightness when at low power (will always be dimmer than at regular power)

3) Q5 Screen Kit Control (OSD, brightness, palette)
- Solder wires from the screen kit to the various pads on the top left corner of the board to control the screen kit
- A, B, and SEL are for the OSD controls, and BAT is for measuring the battery level
- "Up" and "Down" refer to the rocking direction on the rocker switch (where the contrast dial used to be) and are intended to be used with the touch-pads on the screen kit for controlling brightness and color palettes - desolder the touch pads, and in their place solder a wire on each to go from the kit to the MGBC board
- Try to keep the touch-pad wires as close to the board as possible after assembly - if they are touching the shell, then you can accidentally activate the touch controls

Here is an example image from the DMGC project to give you an idea.

4) On the power board, make sure you short R2 with solder, and keep R3 depopulated. R2 is circled in red, R3 is circled in blue.

5) If adding tactile switches, make note that start and select are rotated 90 degrees compared to the other buttons.

6) If you are adding a lipo with the GBPP, **REMOVE EM7**. (I haven't tested this yet.... so do so at your OWN RISK).

7) After you've assembled the PCBs, I suggest you test the output of the regulator board to make sure you are getting 5V out of the output pin *before* connecting it all to the main PCB. So, what you can do is just use wires instead of closer standoffs, and do not wire up the 5V output to the main board (5V output circled in red in the image below). Once you've checked that 5V is being output, then I would go ahead and solder the regulator board on properly.

## PCB Bill of Materials

*These tables are provided above in an Excel format if it's easier to view. (Check the Board Assembly tab)*

Here's a table of the components you'll need for the PCB. Mouser cart with everything that isn't salvaged from an original board is here: https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=1970a339d8

I included multiples of all the passives, since they're small, and a few parts that are prone to being broken. I also added tactile switches to the order, which you can remove if you want the regular OEM feel without clicky buttons. 

Note: You do not need parts for the power board if you are using a GBPP, or Frogulator instead of my power board. I do not condone the use of Retrosix's Clean Power boards.
